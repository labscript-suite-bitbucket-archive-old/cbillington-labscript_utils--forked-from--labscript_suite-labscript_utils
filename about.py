Thank you for installing the labscript suite. We hope it is useful!

Just three things before you go:

1. Give credit appropriately

  You can cite the labscript suite as:

  [RSI citation]

  If you use the labscript suite in work that leads to a publication, it is appropriate
  to cite it. Software is often neglected when it comes to citations, and for commercial
  software perhaps this is ok since its creators are rewarded financially rather than
  academically. However the labscript suite is free and was created by academics taking
  time away from other research, for the benefit of researchers everywhere. Whilst you
  don't need to cite it in every publication, once per apparatus might be reasonable, or
  any time you are describing other details of your experimental setup in a published
  work.


2. Ask for help

  We do not yet have comprehensive documentation, and whilst we hope this situation will
  improve, it is partially mitigated by an active community willing to help. If you're
  having a problem, search the archive of our mailing list to see if your issue is
  addressed, and send a message to the mailing list if it isn't. Unless the content of
  your message includes information you'd rather keep private, it is preferable to post
  publicly to the mailing list rather than privately emailing one of the developers.
  This way if multiple people are having the same issue, the solutions will be there for
  all to see. Feel free to just email the mailing list saying hello. We are always
  interested to know what the labscript suite is being used for and how we could make it
  better.


3. Contribute back

  The labscript suite is a living software project. If you find a bug, please report it
  on BitBucket. If you fix a bug, please make a pull request on BitBucket to share the
  fix. If you implement support for a new device, please make a pull request to get it
  included. And if you are unsure how to do any of this, don't hesitate to ask on the
  mailing list. Even if you do not consider your code particularly good quality,
  contributing it creates a space for anyone interested to discuss what it should look
  like, rather than several groups implementing the same device code and duplicating
  effort. As a general rule: if it is running experiments, it is good enough to be
  included. If there are issues, these can be resolved in the future - merging code into
  labscript does not freeze it in time (anything but!).

  In particular, If you modify labscript-suite code, but do not contribute it back to
  mainline, it is likely that future labscript suite updates will break your code. This
  could leave you unable to update the labscript suite, and limit your changes to only
  working with that particular apparatus, as it will not be updated to be compatible
  with newer versions of Python and its libraries, making it difficult to install
  elsewhere. Getting your changes 'upstreamed' is the best way to ensure they will be
  taken into account in future updates to the software and prevent your changes from
  suffering 'bit-rot'.
